### Before You Begin

- The minimum supported iOS version for SDK `5.x.x` is **iOS 15.0**.
- SDK `5.x.x` requires **Swift 6.0** or later.

### Changed update function

In version `4.x.x`, the `updateTranslation` function was implemented using a callback-based approach.

```swift
do {
    try Phrase.shared.updateTranslation { result in
        switch result {
        case let .success(translationChanged):
            if translationChanged {
                logger.info("Translations changed")
            } else {
                logger.debug("Translations remain unchanged")
            }
        case let .failure(error):
            logger.error("An error occurred: \(error)")
        }
    }
} catch {
    logger.error("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

In version `5.x.x`, this method has been updated to leverage Swift's modern concurrency model and is now implemented using `async/await`.

```swift
Task {
    do {
        let updated = try await Phrase.shared.updateTranslation()
        if updated {
            logger.info("Translations changed")
        } else {
            logger.debug("Translations remain unchanged")
        }
    } catch {
        logger.error("An error occurred: \(error)")
    }
}
```
