# Phrase Over the Air (OTA) SDK for iOS

Publish your translations faster and simpler than ever before. Stop waiting for the next deployment and start publishing all your translations in real-time directly in Phrase Strings.

Head over to the Phrase Help Center to learn about this feature and how to use it in your apps: https://support.phrase.com/hc/en-us/articles/5804059067804

## Instructions

With the SDK, the app regularly checks for updated translations and downloads them in the background.

[Mac Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst) is also supported.

The SDK can be installed manually or via Swift Package Manager, Carthage or Cocoa Pods.

Example [app](https://github.com/phrase/ios-demo-app)

### Swift Package Manager
Add the public repository URL (https://github.com/phrase/ios-sdk/). Xcode automatically handles the rest of the installation.

### Carthage
Add the following line into your Cartfile:

```
binary "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phrase/ios-sdk/master/PhraseSDK.json" ~> 3.0.0
```

Run `carthage update` and add the `PhraseApp.framework` to your project as described in the [Carthage documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).

### Cocoa Pods
Add the following line into your Podfile:

```
pod 'PhraseSDK'
```
Run `pod install`. If new to CocoaPods, see their [documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/phrase/ios-sdk/releases).
2. Add PhraseSDK.framework in Xcode as the linked binary to the target.
3. A script to strip the extra binaries needs to be run before you upload the app as the Apple store rejects apps including simulator binaries.

Go to *Build Phases* and add a *Run Script* section by clicking the + symbol. Paste in this script:

```
FRAMEWORK="PhraseSDK"
FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/$FRAMEWORK.framework/$FRAMEWORK"
EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()
for ARCH in $ARCHS
do
   lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
   EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
done
lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
```

### Configuration

1. Import PhraseSDK
```
import PhraseSDK
```

2. Initialize the SDK
```
Phrase.shared.setup(
  distributionID: <Distribution ID>,
  environmentSecret: <Environment Secret>
)
```

3. Update translations

To update localization files call `Phrase.shared.updateTranslation()`. This method will raises an exception if SDK is not correctly setup.

To configure OTA to use the US data center, set the host before calling `PhraseApp.shared.updateTranslation()` with `Phrase.shared.configuration.apiHost = .us.`

Calling both functions within the `AppDelegate` in the `applicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method is recommended.

### Objective-C

Integrate the SDK into the Objective-C application:

```objective-c
@import PhraseSDK;

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  [[Phrase shared] setDebugMode:true]; // Optional

  [[Phrase shared] setupWithDistributionID:@"Your Distribution ID"
                         environmentSecret:@"Your Environment Secret"];

  // OR:
  //
  //  [[Phrase shared] setupWithDistributionID:@"Your Distribution ID"
  //                         environmentSecret:@"Your Environment Secret"
  //                                   timeout:10];

  // Update translations using callback block:
  [[Phrase shared] updateTranslationsWithCompletionHandler:^(BOOL updated, NSError* error){
    NSLog(@"Updated: %@", updated ? @"true" : @"false");

    if (error) {
      NSLog(@"Domain: %@ Code: %ld Message: %@", error.domain, (long)error.code, error.localizedDescription);
    } else {
      NSLog(@"No error");
    }

    // Translate via bundle proxy:
    NSString *translation = NSLocalizedString(@"layouts.application.about", @"");
    NSLog(@"NSLocalizedString via bundle proxy: %@", translation);

    // OR:
    //
    // Translate using fallback method:
    NSString *otherTranslation = [[Phrase shared]
                                  localizedStringForKey:@"layouts.application.about" value:NULL table:NULL];
    NSLog(@"Phrase.shared localizedStringForKey: %@", otherTranslation);
  }];

  // OR:
  //
  // [[Phrase shared] updateTranslationsWithCompletionHandler:NULL]; // ignore result and errors (not recommended)

  // [...] Your other code

  return YES;
}
```

### Disable swizzling

To disable swizzling, set `PhraseSDKMainBundleProxyDisabled` to **YES** in the `Info.plist` file.

When swizzling is disabled, updated translations are no longer be displayed. The translation will still be synced if `updateTranslation` is called and can be accessed with the Phrase.`localizedString()` method.

### App version handling

To determine which release should be returned the SDK requires a semantic version of the app so translations are updated.

The SDK attempts to get a semantic version the following way:

- `CFBundleShortVersionString` is used if semantic.
- If not, `CFBundleVersion` is used if semantic.
- If both are not semantic, a combination of (`CFBundleShortVersionString.CFBundleVersion`) is used.

If `CFBundleShortVersionString` is missing or unable to be created with a semantic version together with `CFBundleVersion`, the SDK throws the `PhraseSetupError.appVersionNotSemantic` message.

### Disable translation for multiple tables

To prevent OTA from translating any tables in the main iOS bundle other than the default `Localizable` table, set the following option:

```
Phrase.shared.configuration.ignoreOtherTables = true
```

### Callbacks

Attach a callback handler to handle successful translation updates:

```
Phrase.shared.updateTranslation { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let updated):
            case .failure:
            }
        }
```

### Debug mode

If further information is required, enable the debug mode to get additional logging of the `PhraseSDK.framework` into the console:

```
Phrase.shared.configuration.debugMode = true
```

### Set timeout for requests

Set a timeout for the requests against Phrase by calling:

```
Phrase.shared.configuration.timeout = TimeInterval(20)
```

The default timeout is 10 seconds and connections taking longer than 10 seconds will be closed.

### Provide manual language override

If not using the system language as the locale, a different locale can be set in the init call. The locale code needs to be present in a release from Phrase:

```
Phrase.shared.configuration.localeOverride = "en-US"
```

### Fallback

In case new translations cannot be fetched from Phrase via the SDK, the latest translation files that the installation received are used. If the App never received new files from Phrase, it uses the compiled translation files of app. This prevents errors in case of any technical difficulties or networking errors. Keeping your translation files that are compiled into the app up to date with every release is recommended.

### Troubleshooting

**If translations are not being updated:**
- Ensure distribution id and environment secret are correct.
- Ensure a release was created on for the current app version.

If the wrong version of a translation is being used, ensure a release with the latest translations and the current app version is available.

### Auditing
The SDK is closed source and can not be viewed or modified. If it is an organization requirement, audits can be provided. [Contact us](https://phrase.com/contact/) for more details if required.

## Migration Guide: From Version 4.x.x to 5.x.x

### Before You Begin

Hereâ€™s what you need to know before updating to SDK `5.x.x`:

- The minimum supported iOS version for SDK `5.x.x` is **iOS 15.0**.
- SDK `5.x.x` requires **Swift 6.0** or later.

---

### Changed update function

In version `4.x.x`, the `updateTranslation` function was implemented using a callback-based approach.

```swift
do {
    try Phrase.shared.updateTranslation { result in
        switch result {
        case let .success(translationChanged):
            if translationChanged {
                logger.info("Translations changed")
            } else {
                logger.debug("Translations remain unchanged")
            }
        case let .failure(error):
            logger.error("An error occurred: \(error)")
        }
    }
} catch {
    logger.error("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

In version `5.x.x`, this method has been updated to leverage Swift's modern concurrency model and is now implemented using `async/await`.

```swift
Task {
    do {
        let updated = try await Phrase.shared.updateTranslation()
        if updated {
            logger.info("Translations changed")
        } else {
            logger.debug("Translations remain unchanged")
        }
    } catch {
        logger.error("An error occurred: \(error)")
    }
}
```
